2023-11-14 Refactor REVIEW if to make Spectator-Screen-Runner ? simpler version without interval auto-run
Option to set if Only players can hear the sound (e.g. in a concert or conference)
can optimize spawner maybe? remove entity and reuse later, when creating sprie in screen, if there is available, use it instead of creating a new one
each mini-game can have own sprite-sheet with instructions, which is a full screen with frames like a gif, like 2, 3 or 4 frames, 1 per second
when player loads scene and server is down, try to connect on interval , or with button?
